Cakeupload plugin
-----------------

A few days ago we were using the swfupload object to upload files inside our cake project.
After a small configuration change in the project, the uploader component just blew away and started throwing a IOException (no trace, no clues) error.
Probably it's our fault, but we were totally dissapointed with that...

This plugin is the natural reaction to that feeling.

INSTALLATION
------------

Download and unzip the plugin unde /app/plugins/cakeupload folder or go to /app/plugins folder and type

  git clone git://github.com/steinkel/cakeupload.git

Run SQL file /app/plugins/cakeupload/config/sql/database.sql into your database
This script creates a 'cakeupload_files' table, used to store all the upload files.

USAGE
-----

In your controller, use the component

  var $helpers = array('Cakeupload.Upload');

In your view put the upload button

  <?php echo $upload->button('upload file');?>
  

That's it !


TODO
----
disallow certain filetypes by default
upload folder and other parameters by config
mime types check

THANKS

This project is based on https://github.com/valums/file-uploader
